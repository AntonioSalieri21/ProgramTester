A C# program (GitHub incorrectly identifies the language due to the presence of test programs in the directory) designed for checking competition programs/hackathons. 
It was written in 2017 when I was still a child, so the main branch contains outdated code. The Rework branch will contain the rewritten code.
Tasks:
 - [ ] Redo the project
 - [ ] OPTIONAL - add an interface using React or Electron
